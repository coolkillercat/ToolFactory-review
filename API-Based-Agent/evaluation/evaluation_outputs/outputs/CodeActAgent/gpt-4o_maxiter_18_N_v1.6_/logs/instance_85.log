Step 4:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: To find the estimated driving time from La Quinta Inn near the airport to Carnegie Mellon University, I will follow these steps:

1. List the available tools for the map site to see what functionalities are available.
2. Check the documentation for the relevant tool that can provide driving directions or estimated driving time.
3. Use the appropriate API call to get the estimated driving time.

Let's start by listing the available tools for the map site.
CODE:
from utils import list_tools
list_tools(site='map')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
DEBUG: Starting list_tools for site 'map'
DEBUG: Looking for tool descriptions at: /workspace/api/map/tool_descriptions.json

Step 5:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: To find the estimated driving time, the `route_service_GET` tool seems appropriate as it is used to find the fastest route between coordinates. Let's check the documentation for this tool to understand how to use it.
CODE:
from utils import get_documentation
get_documentation('route_service_GET', site='map')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
DEBUG: Looking for module at /workspace/api/map/tools/route_service_GET.py
'"""\nFinds the fastest route between coordinates in the supplied order.\n\n    Args:\n        coordinates: String of coordinates in format \'lon,lat;lon,lat;lon,lat\'\n        alternatives: Boolean or number indicating whether to return alternative routes\n        steps: Boolean indicating whether to return steps\n        geometries: Format of the returned geometry (polyline, polyline6, geojson)\n        overview: Level of detail for the returned geometry (full, simplified, false)\n        annotations: Boolean indicating whether to return additional metadata\n\n    Returns:\n        Response object from the OSRM API\n""" example: route_service('

Step 6:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `route_service_GET` tool allows us to find the fastest route between coordinates. It requires the following parameters:

- `coordinates`: A string of coordinates in the format 'lon,lat;lon,lat;lon,lat'.
- `alternatives`: Whether to return alternative routes.
- `steps`: Whether to return steps.
- `geometries`: Format of the returned geometry.
- `overview`: Level of detail for the returned geometry.
- `annotations`: Whether to return additional metadata.

To proceed, I need to determine the coordinates for La Quinta Inn near the airport and Carnegie Mellon University. Once I have these coordinates, I can use the `route_service_GET` tool to find the estimated driving time.

Let's start by finding the coordinates for these locations using the `search_api_GET` tool, which allows us to look up a location from a textual description or address. I'll first check the documentation for this tool.
CODE:
get_documentation('search_api_GET', site='map')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
DEBUG: Looking for module at /workspace/api/map/tools/search_api_GET.py

Step 7:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `search_api_GET` tool allows us to search for places using a query string. We can use this tool to find the coordinates for "La Quinta Inn near the airport" and "Carnegie Mellon University."

Let's start by searching for "La Quinta Inn near the airport" to get its coordinates.
CODE:
from utils import call_function

# Search for La Quinta Inn near the airport
la_quinta_search_result = call_function('search_api_GET', site='map', q='La Quinta Inn near the airport', limit=1, format='jsonv2')

Step 8:

THOUGHT: It seems there was an issue with retrieving the search results for "La Quinta Inn near the airport." The response did not contain the expected JSON data. Let's try again to ensure we get the correct data.

I'll attempt the search again for "La Quinta Inn near the airport" to retrieve its coordinates.
CODE:
# Retry searching for La Quinta Inn near the airport
la_quinta_search_result_retry = call_function('search_api_GET', site='map', q='La Quinta Inn near the airport', limit=1, format='jsonv2')

<Response [200]>

Step 9:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: It seems there is a persistent issue with retrieving the search results for "La Quinta Inn near the airport." The response is not providing the expected JSON data. This might be due to a problem with the API or the query itself.

Let's try searching for "Carnegie Mellon University" to see if we can retrieve its coordinates successfully.

Step 10:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: It appears that there is a consistent issue with retrieving the expected JSON data from the search API. This might be due to a problem with the API or the way the requests are being handled.

Given this situation, I will attempt to use a different approach to obtain the coordinates for both locations. I will try using a different tool or method to retrieve the necessary data.

Let's try using the `place_details_GET` tool to see if it can provide the coordinates for "Carnegie Mellon University." I'll first check the documentation for this tool.
CODE:
get_documentation('place_details_GET', site='map')
