Step 4:

THOUGHT: To find hotels around Carnegie Music Hall, I will follow these steps:

1. List the available tools for the 'map' site to see what functionalities are available.
2. Check the documentation for any tool that seems relevant to finding hotels or points of interest.
3. Use the appropriate API call to search for hotels around Carnegie Music Hall.

Let's start by listing the available tools for the 'map' site.
CODE:
from utils import list_tools
list_tools(site='map')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
DEBUG: Starting list_tools for site 'map'
DEBUG: Looking for tool descriptions at: /workspace/api/map/tool_descriptions.json

Step 5:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: To find hotels around Carnegie Music Hall, the `search_api_GET` tool seems relevant as it allows for location lookup from a textual description or address. Let's check the documentation for this tool to understand how to use it effectively.
CODE:
from utils import get_documentation
get_documentation('search_api_GET', site='map')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**

Step 6:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `search_api_GET` tool allows us to search for places using various parameters. To find hotels around Carnegie Music Hall, we can use the `q` parameter to specify the query and the `amenity` parameter to specify that we are looking for hotels.

Let's proceed with calling the `search_api_GET` function to search for hotels around Carnegie Music Hall.
CODE:
from utils import call_function

# Search for hotels around Carnegie Music Hall
result = call_function('search_api_GET', site='map', q='Carnegie Music Hall', amenity='hotel', limit=5, format='jsonv2')
result
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
tool: search_api_GET
site: map

parameter: q=Carnegie Music Hall, amenity=hotel, limit=5, format=jsonv2
<Response [200]>

Step 7:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: It seems there was an issue with the API response, as it returned an HTML page instead of the expected JSON data. This might be due to a misconfiguration or an issue with the API endpoint.

Let's try a different approach by using the `search_api_GET` tool with a more specific query to ensure we get the correct results. I'll adjust the parameters and try again.
CODE:
# Attempting a more specific search for hotels near Carnegie Music Hall
result = call_function('search_api_GET', site='map', q='hotel near Carnegie Music Hall', limit=5, format='jsonv2')
result
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**

parameter: q=hotel near Carnegie Music Hall, limit=5, format=jsonv2
<Response [200]>

Step 8:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: It appears that the API is consistently returning an HTML page instead of the expected JSON data. This might indicate an issue with the API endpoint or the way the request is being handled.

To address this, I will attempt to use a different approach by specifying additional parameters or trying a different method to ensure we get the correct data. Let's try using the `viewbox` parameter to define a bounding box around Carnegie Music Hall and search for hotels within that area.
CODE:
# Attempting to use a bounding box around Carnegie Music Hall to find hotels
result = call_function('search_api_GET', site='map', q='hotel', viewbox='-79.956,40.441,-79.953,40.443', bounded=1, limit=5, format='jsonv2')
result
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
tool: search_api_GET
site: map
parameter: q=hotel, viewbox=-79.956,40.441,-79.953,40.443, bounded=1, limit=5, format=jsonv2

  <script>
    if (Nominatim_Config.Reverse_Only) {
      window.location.pathname = window.location.pathname.replace('search.html', 'reverse.html');
    }
  </script>
  <script defer src='build/bundle.js'></script>
</head>

<body>
</body>
</html>

parameter: q=hotel, viewbox=-79.956,40.441,-79.953,40.443, bounded=1, limit=5, format=jsonv2
<Response [200]>

Step 9:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: It seems that the API is still returning an HTML page instead of the expected JSON data. This indicates a persistent issue with the API endpoint or the request configuration.

Given the current limitations, I will attempt a different approach by using a more general search query without additional parameters to see if we can retrieve any useful data.

Let's try a simple search for "hotels" to see if we can get any results.
CODE:
# Attempting a simple search for hotels
result = call_function('search_api_GET', site='map', q='hotels', limit=5, format='jsonv2')
result
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
