Step 5:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: To find the zip code of Columbia University, the `search_api_GET` tool seems appropriate as it allows looking up a location from a textual description or address. Let's check the documentation for this tool to understand how to use it.
CODE:

Step 6:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `search_api_GET` tool allows us to search for places using a query string. We can use this tool to search for Columbia University and retrieve its address details, including the zip code. Let's proceed with calling this function to find the zip code of Columbia University.
CODE:
from utils import call_function

I'll make sure to specify the correct headers and parameters to get the JSON response. Let's try this again.

Step 8:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: It seems that the API call is still returning an HTML page instead of the expected JSON response. This might be due to a misconfiguration or an issue with the API endpoint. 

Let's try a different approach by using another tool or adjusting the parameters to ensure we get the correct response. I'll attempt to use the `search_api_GET` tool with a different configuration to retrieve the zip code for Columbia University. 

I'll try specifying additional parameters to narrow down the search and ensure we get the correct JSON response. Let's proceed with this approach.

# Attempting the API call again with additional parameters

Step 9:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: It appears that the API call is consistently returning an HTML page instead of the expected JSON data. This might be due to an issue with the API endpoint or the way the request is being handled.

Given the current situation, I will attempt to use a different approach to retrieve the zip code for Columbia University. I will try using another tool or method to obtain the required information. Let's explore the available options again to see if there is an alternative tool that can be used for this task. 

I'll review the list of available tools once more to identify any other potential options.

Step 10:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: Given the tools available, the `place_details_GET` tool might be useful as it shows all details about a single place saved in the database. This could potentially provide the zip code for Columbia University. Let's check the documentation for this tool to understand how to use it.
CODE:
get_documentation('place_details_GET', site='map')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**

Step 11:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `place_details_GET` tool requires specific parameters such as `osmtype`, `osmid`, or `place_id` to retrieve detailed information about a place. Since we don't have these identifiers for Columbia University, we need to first obtain them.

To do this, we can use the `search_api_GET` tool to find the place ID or OSM ID for Columbia University. Once we have that information, we can use the `place_details_GET` tool to get the detailed address, including the zip code.

Let's attempt to use the `search_api_GET` tool again to find the place ID or OSM ID for Columbia University.
CODE:

Step 12:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: It seems that the API call is still returning an HTML page instead of the expected JSON data. This indicates a persistent issue with the API endpoint or the request configuration.

Given the current limitations, I will attempt to use a different approach to obtain the zip code for Columbia University. I will try using the `general_request_GET` tool to make a direct request to the Nominatim API with the appropriate parameters to retrieve the necessary information.

Let's proceed with this approach.
