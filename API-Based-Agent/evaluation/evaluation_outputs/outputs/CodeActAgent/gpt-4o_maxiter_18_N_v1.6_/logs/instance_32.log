Step 4:

THOUGHT: To accomplish the task, I will follow these steps:

1. **Find a Hilton hotel near Pittsburgh Airport**: I will use the map API to search for Hilton hotels in the vicinity of Pittsburgh Airport.
2. **Identify the nearest supermarket owned by a local company**: I will search for supermarkets near the identified Hilton hotel and determine if they are owned by a local company.
3. **Calculate the walking distance**: I will calculate the walking distance from the Hilton hotel to the nearest local supermarket.

Let's start by exploring the available map APIs to find a Hilton hotel near Pittsburgh Airport.

Step 5:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: To find a Hilton hotel near Pittsburgh Airport, I will use the `search_api_GET` tool, which allows for location searches based on textual descriptions or addresses. Let's check the documentation for this tool to understand how to use it effectively.
CODE:

Step 6:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `search_api_GET` tool allows us to search for places using various parameters. To find a Hilton hotel near Pittsburgh Airport, I will perform a search using the query string "Hilton Hotel" and specify the city as "Pittsburgh" to narrow down the results.

Let's proceed with calling the `search_api_GET` to find a Hilton hotel near Pittsburgh Airport.
CODE:
from utils import call_function

# Search for Hilton hotels near Pittsburgh Airport
result = call_function('search_api_GET', site='map', q='Hilton Hotel', city='Pittsburgh', limit=1, format='jsonv2')

Step 7:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: It seems there was an issue with retrieving the expected JSON response from the API. The response returned an HTML page instead of the JSON data. This might be due to a misconfiguration or an issue with the API endpoint.

Let's try a different approach by using the `nearest_service_GET` tool to find the nearest Hilton hotel to Pittsburgh Airport. This tool can snap a coordinate to the street network and return the nearest matches. First, I'll check the documentation for `nearest_service_GET` to understand how to use it.
CODE:
get_documentation('nearest_service_GET', site='map')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
DEBUG: Looking for module at /workspace/api/map/tools/nearest_service_GET.py

Step 8:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `nearest_service_GET` tool allows us to find the nearest segments to a given coordinate. To find a Hilton hotel near Pittsburgh Airport, I will use the coordinates of Pittsburgh Airport and search for nearby Hilton hotels.

First, I'll need to find the coordinates for Pittsburgh Airport. Then, I'll use these coordinates to search for the nearest Hilton hotel.

Let's start by finding the coordinates for Pittsburgh Airport using the `search_api_GET` tool.
CODE:
# Search for Pittsburgh Airport to get its coordinates
airport_result = call_function('search_api_GET', site='map', q='Pittsburgh International Airport', limit=1, format='jsonv2')

THOUGHT: It seems there is a consistent issue with retrieving JSON data from the API, as it is returning an HTML page instead. This might be due to a misconfiguration or an issue with the API endpoint.

Given this situation, I will attempt a different approach by using the `search_api_GET` tool with a more specific query to directly find a Hilton hotel in Pittsburgh. Let's try searching for "Hilton Hotel Pittsburgh" to see if we can get a valid response.
CODE:
# Attempt to search for a Hilton hotel in Pittsburgh directly

Step 10:
act - **MessageAction** (source=EventSource.AGENT)
CONTENT: It appears that the API is consistently returning an HTML page instead of the expected JSON data. This issue prevents us from retrieving the necessary information about Hilton hotels or Pittsburgh Airport coordinates.

Given the limitations of the current API responses, I am unable to proceed with finding a Hilton hotel near Pittsburgh Airport or calculating the walking distance to a local supermarket.

If there are any other approaches or tools you would like me to try, please let me know. Otherwise, I will conclude the task due to the limitations encountered with the API responses.

After that, when you responded with your answer, you should respond with <finish></finish>.
Then finally, to exit, you can run <execute_bash>
exit()
</execute_bash>
obs - NullObservation(content='', observation='null')

Step 12:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: Given the challenges with retrieving data from the API, I will attempt a different approach by using the `place_details_GET` tool to directly obtain details about a Hilton hotel in Pittsburgh. This tool is meant for visual inspection of data in the database and might provide the necessary information.

Let's check the documentation for `place_details_GET` to understand how to use it.
CODE:
get_documentation('place_details_GET', site='map')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
DEBUG: Looking for module at /workspace/api/map/tools/place_details_GET.py
'"""\nRetrieves detailed information about a place from the Nominatim OpenStreetMap API.\n\n    Parameters:\n    - osmtype: OSM type (N, W, R for node, way, relation)\n    - osmid: OSM ID of the object\n    - class_: Class of the object\n    - place_id: Place ID\n    - json_callback: Wraps the return in a JavaScript callback function\n    - pretty: Returns formatted JSON\n    - addressdetails: Include address details in the response\n    - keywords: Include keyword information\n    - linkedplaces: Include linked places\n    - hierarchy: Include place hierarchy\n    - group_hierarchy: Group hierarchy results\n    - polygon_geojson: Return geometry as GeoJSON\n    - accept_language: Preferred language for results\n""" example: place_details('

Step 13:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `place_details_GET` tool retrieves detailed information about a place using parameters like OSM type, OSM ID, and place ID. However, to use this tool, we need specific identifiers for the place, which we currently do not have due to the issues with the previous API calls.

Given the constraints, I will attempt to use the `search_api_GET` tool again with a different query to see if we can retrieve any useful data. I will try a broader search for "hotel" in Pittsburgh to see if we can get any results.

Let's proceed with this approach.
