Step 4:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: To accomplish the task, I need to follow these steps:

1. Identify available APIs related to maps to find a Hyatt hotel near Pittsburgh Airport.
2. Use the appropriate API to search for hotels in the vicinity of Pittsburgh Airport.
3. Identify a Hyatt hotel from the search results.
4. Find the nearest supermarket to the identified Hyatt hotel.
5. Calculate the shortest walking time from the Hyatt hotel to the supermarket.

Let's start by listing the available tools for the map site to find a Hyatt hotel near Pittsburgh Airport.

Step 5:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: To find a Hyatt hotel near Pittsburgh Airport, I will use the `search_api_GET` tool, which allows for location searches based on textual descriptions or addresses. Let's first check the documentation for this tool to understand how to use it effectively.
CODE:
from utils import get_documentation
get_documentation('search_api_GET', site='map')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
DEBUG: Looking for module at /workspace/api/map/tools/search_api_GET.py

Step 6:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `search_api_GET` tool allows us to search for places using various parameters. To find a Hyatt hotel near Pittsburgh Airport, I will perform a search using the query string "Hyatt Hotel" and specify the location as Pittsburgh.

Let's proceed with calling the `search_api_GET` to find a Hyatt hotel near Pittsburgh Airport.
CODE:
from utils import call_function

# Search for a Hyatt hotel near Pittsburgh Airport
result = call_function('search_api_GET', site='map', q='Hyatt Hotel', city='Pittsburgh', limit=1, format='jsonv2')

Step 7:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: It seems there was an issue with retrieving the expected JSON response from the API. The response returned an HTML page instead of the JSON data. This might be due to a misconfiguration or an issue with the API endpoint.

To proceed, I'll attempt to refine the search query and ensure the correct parameters are being used. Let's try again to get the JSON response for a Hyatt hotel near Pittsburgh Airport.
CODE:

<Response [200]>

Step 8:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: It appears that the API is still returning an HTML page instead of the expected JSON data. This could be due to a misconfiguration or an issue with the API endpoint itself.

To troubleshoot, I will try using a different approach by specifying additional parameters or using a different tool if available. Let's attempt to use the `place_details_GET` tool to see if it can provide the necessary information about a Hyatt hotel near Pittsburgh Airport.

First, I'll check the documentation for the `place_details_GET` tool to understand its usage.
CODE:
get_documentation('place_details_GET', site='map')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
DEBUG: Looking for module at /workspace/api/map/tools/place_details_GET.py
'"""\nRetrieves detailed information about a place from the Nominatim OpenStreetMap API.\n\n    Parameters:\n    - osmtype: OSM type (N, W, R for node, way, relation)\n    - osmid: OSM ID of the object\n    - class_: Class of the object\n    - place_id: Place ID\n    - json_callback: Wraps the return in a JavaScript callback function\n    - pretty: Returns formatted JSON\n    - addressdetails: Include address details in the response\n    - keywords: Include keyword information\n    - linkedplaces: Include linked places\n    - hierarchy: Include place hierarchy\n    - group_hierarchy: Group hierarchy results\n    - polygon_geojson: Return geometry as GeoJSON\n    - accept_language: Preferred language for results\n""" example: place_details('

Step 9:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `place_details_GET` tool retrieves detailed information about a place using parameters like OSM type, OSM ID, and place ID. However, to use this tool, we need specific identifiers for the place, which we currently do not have.

Since the previous attempts to use the `search_api_GET` tool did not yield the expected results, I will try using the `nearest_service_GET` tool to find the nearest Hyatt hotel by specifying the coordinates of Pittsburgh Airport. This tool can snap a coordinate to the street network and return the nearest matches.

First, I'll check the documentation for the `nearest_service_GET` tool to understand how to use it.
CODE:
get_documentation('nearest_service_GET', site='map')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
DEBUG: Looking for module at /workspace/api/map/tools/nearest_service_GET.py
'"""\nSnaps a coordinate to the street network and returns the nearest n matches.\n\nParameters:\n- coordinates: A single {longitude},{latitude} entry.\n- number: Number of nearest segments that should be returned.\n""" example: nearest_service(coordinates="""13.388860,52.517037""", number=3)'

Step 10:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `nearest_service_GET` tool can be used to find the nearest segments to a given coordinate. To find a Hyatt hotel near Pittsburgh Airport, I will use the coordinates of the airport and search for nearby amenities.

First, I need to find the coordinates for Pittsburgh Airport. Then, I'll use these coordinates to find the nearest Hyatt hotel.

Let's start by finding the coordinates for Pittsburgh Airport.

Step 11:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: It seems that the API is still returning an HTML page instead of the expected JSON data. This issue might be due to a misconfiguration or an issue with the API endpoint itself.

Given the current limitations, I will attempt to use a different approach to find the coordinates of Pittsburgh International Airport. Once I have the coordinates, I can proceed with finding the nearest Hyatt hotel.

Let's try using the `general_request_GET` tool to make a direct request to the Nominatim API for the coordinates of Pittsburgh International Airport.
CODE:
get_documentation('general_request_GET', site='map')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**

Step 12:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `general_request_GET` tool is designed for making requests to the OSRM API, which is primarily used for routing and navigation services. It may not be suitable for directly querying location data like the Nominatim API.

Given the current challenges with retrieving data from the Nominatim API, I will attempt to use the `nearest_service_GET` tool directly with approximate coordinates for Pittsburgh International Airport. The coordinates for Pittsburgh International Airport are approximately 40.4914° N, 80.2329° W.

Let's proceed with using the `nearest_service_GET` tool to find the nearest Hyatt hotel using these coordinates.
CODE:

<Response [200]>

Step 13:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `nearest_service_GET` tool returned a list of waypoints, but the coordinates seem to be incorrect, as they are located far from Pittsburgh. This might be due to an error in the request or the service not being suitable for finding specific amenities like hotels.

Given the current limitations and the incorrect results, I will attempt to use the `search_api_GET` tool again with a different approach to find a Hyatt hotel near Pittsburgh Airport. I will specify the query more precisely and ensure the correct parameters are used.

Let's try searching for a Hyatt hotel near Pittsburgh Airport once more.
