Step 4:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: To find the minimum travel time by car from CMU Gates Building to Schenley Park, I will follow these steps:

1. List the available tools for the map site to see what functionalities are available.
2. Check the documentation for any relevant tools that can provide travel time information.
3. Use the appropriate API call to get the travel time.

Let's start by listing the available tools for the map site.

list_tools(site='map')

DEBUG: Starting list_tools for site 'map'
DEBUG: Looking for tool descriptions at: /workspace/api/map/tool_descriptions.json

Step 5:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: To find the minimum travel time by car, the `route_service_GET` tool seems relevant as it finds the fastest route between coordinates. Let's check the documentation for this tool to understand how to use it.
CODE:
from utils import get_documentation
get_documentation('route_service_GET', site='map')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**

Step 6:
act - **MessageAction** (source=EventSource.AGENT)
CONTENT: The `route_service_GET` tool allows us to find the fastest route between coordinates. It requires the coordinates in the format `'lon,lat;lon,lat'`. We need to provide the coordinates for the CMU Gates Building and Schenley Park.

Let's proceed with the following steps:
1. Determine the coordinates for CMU Gates Building and Schenley Park.
2. Use the `route_service_GET` tool to find the fastest route and travel time.

I'll start by finding the coordinates for these locations.
obs - NullObservation(content='', observation='null')

Step 7:
act - **MessageAction** (source=EventSource.USER)

After that, when you responded with your answer, you should respond with <finish></finish>.
Then finally, to exit, you can run <execute_bash>
exit()
</execute_bash>
obs - NullObservation(content='', observation='null')

Step 8:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: To proceed, I'll first find the coordinates for the CMU Gates Building and Schenley Park. Then, I'll use these coordinates to call the `route_service_GET` tool to find the minimum travel time by car.

Let's start by finding the coordinates for these locations. I'll use the `search_api_GET` tool to look up the locations based on their names.

First, I'll check the documentation for the `search_api_GET` tool to understand how to use it.
CODE:
get_documentation('search_api_GET', site='map')

Step 9:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `search_api_GET` tool allows us to search for places using a query string. We can use this tool to find the coordinates for the CMU Gates Building and Schenley Park.

Let's start by searching for the coordinates of the CMU Gates Building.
CODE:
from utils import call_function

Step 10:

THOUGHT: It seems there was an issue with retrieving the coordinates for the CMU Gates Building. The response did not contain the expected JSON data. Let's try again to ensure we get the correct information.

I'll attempt to retrieve the coordinates for the CMU Gates Building once more.

<Response [200]>

Step 11:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: It seems there is a persistent issue with retrieving the coordinates using the `search_api_GET` tool. The response is not providing the expected JSON data. 

As an alternative, I will manually provide the coordinates for the CMU Gates Building and Schenley Park, which are commonly known:

- CMU Gates Building: Latitude 40.4433, Longitude -79.9446
- Schenley Park: Latitude 40.4387, Longitude -79.9465

Now, I'll use these coordinates to call the `route_service_GET` tool to find the minimum travel time by car.

# Use the route_service_GET tool to find the fastest route
route_result = call_function(
