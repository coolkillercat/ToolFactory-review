Step 4:

Step 5:

Step 6:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `search_api_GET` tool allows us to search for locations using a free-form query string. We can use this tool to search for "Columbia University" and retrieve its details, including the zip code. Let's proceed with calling this function.

I'll perform the search using the query "Columbia University" and request the results in JSON format with address details included. Let's execute this search now.
