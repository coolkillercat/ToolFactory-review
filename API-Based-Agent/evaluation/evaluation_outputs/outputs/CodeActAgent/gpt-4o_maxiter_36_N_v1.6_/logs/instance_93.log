When you think you successfully finished the task, first respond with `Finish[answer]` where you include *only* your answer to the questionin `[]` if the user asks for an answer, make sure you should only include the answer to the question but not any additional explanation, details, or commentary unless specifically requested.
After that, when you responded with your answer, you should respond with <finish></finish>.

Step 4:
act - **MessageAction** (source=EventSource.AGENT)
CONTENT: To determine which US states border New Hampshire, I will follow these steps:

1. List the available tools for the 'map' site to see if there is a tool that can help identify bordering states.
2. Check the documentation for any relevant tool that might provide information about state borders.
3. Use the appropriate tool to find out which states border New Hampshire.

Let's start by listing the available tools for the 'map' site.

Step 5:
act - **MessageAction** (source=EventSource.USER)

Step 7:

CONTENT: From the list of available tools, none of them seem to directly provide information about state borders. However, the `search_api_GET` tool might be useful if it allows for location-based queries that could include border information.

Let's check the documentation for the `search_api_GET` tool to see if it can help us find the states bordering New Hampshire.

Step 9:
act - **MessageAction** (source=EventSource.AGENT)

The US states that border New Hampshire are:

Step 10:
