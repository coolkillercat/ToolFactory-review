Given the tools available, it seems there is no direct tool for updating the shipping address of an order. The tools primarily focus on cart operations, product management, and other functionalities.

Since I have explored the available tools and documentation, and there is no direct method to update the shipping address for an order, it might be necessary to handle this through a different process or system not covered by the current API tools.

Therefore, based on the current capabilities, I am unable to change the delivery address for the most recent order using the provided API tools.
