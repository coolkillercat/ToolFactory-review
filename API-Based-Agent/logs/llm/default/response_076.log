The `set_shipping_and_billing_information_POST` tool seems to be used for setting shipping and billing information, but it appears to be related to a cart rather than an order. Since there is no documentation available, I need to find another tool that specifically updates the shipping address for an order.

Let's search for a tool that might allow updating the shipping address directly for an order.

get_documentation('load_order_GET', site='shopping')
