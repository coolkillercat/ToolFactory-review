It seems there is no tool named `update_order_POST` available for updating an order's shipping address directly. Given the available tools, I will need to explore other options or combinations of tools that might allow updating the shipping address.

Let's try to find any other tool that might be related to updating order information or shipping details.
<execute_ipython>
get_documentation('update_order_address_POST', site='shopping')
