To change the delivery address for the most recent order, I need to:

1. Retrieve the list of orders to find the most recent one.
2. Update the delivery address for that order.

First, I'll check the documentation for the `list_orders_GET` tool to understand how to retrieve the list of orders.
<execute_ipython>
from utils import get_documentation
get_documentation('list_orders_GET', site='shopping')
