It seems there is no direct tool available for updating the shipping address of an order. Given the tools available, it might be necessary to use a combination of tools or a different approach to achieve this task.

Since I have not found a specific tool for updating the shipping address, I will try to find any other tool that might allow modifying order attributes or details. Let's explore the list of tools again to see if there is any other tool that might be relevant.
