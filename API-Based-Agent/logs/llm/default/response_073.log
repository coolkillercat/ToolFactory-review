To retrieve the most recent order, I will use the `list_orders_GET` tool with sorting by the `created_at` field in descending order to get the latest order first. Let's proceed with that.

<execute_ipython>
from utils import call_function

# Retrieve the most recent order by sorting by 'created_at' in descending order
orders = call_function(
    'list_orders_GET',
    site='shopping',
    searchCriteria_sortOrders__0__field_='created_at',
    searchCriteria_sortOrders__0__direction_='DESC',
    searchCriteria_pageSize_=1,
    searchCriteria_currentPage_=1
)
orders
