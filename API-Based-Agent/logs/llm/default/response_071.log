To change the delivery address for the most recent order, I need to follow these steps:

1. List available tools for the shopping site to find the relevant APIs.
2. Use the appropriate API to retrieve the most recent order.
3. Use the appropriate API to update the delivery address for that order.

Let's start by listing the available tools for the shopping site.

CODE:
from utils import list_tools
list_tools(site='shopping')
