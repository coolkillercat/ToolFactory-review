The `load_order_GET` tool is used to load a specified order item, but it doesn't seem to be related to updating the shipping address.

Since I haven't found a tool specifically for updating the shipping address of an order, I'll try to find a tool that might allow updating order details or attributes, which could include the shipping address.

Let's search for a tool that might allow updating order details.

get_documentation('update_order_POST', site='shopping')
