Let's perform this search to get the coordinates.
CODE:
# Refined search for Starbucks on Craig Street in Pittsburgh

Step 29:
act - **MessageAction** (source=EventSource.AGENT)
CONTENT: The coordinates for "Starbucks on Craig Street" are:
- Latitude: 40.4446025
- Longitude: -79.9485226

Now that we have the coordinates for all three locations, I will use the `trip_service_GET` tool to calculate the optimal route. The journey begins at "Carnegie Mellon University" and includes the other two locations.

Let's calculate the optimal route using these coordinates.

Step 30:

CONTENT: Please continue working on the task on whatever approach you think is suitable.

When you think you successfully finished the task, first respond with `Finish[answer]` where you include *only* your answer to the questionin `[]` if the user asks for an answer, make sure you should only include the answer to the question but not any additional explanation, details, or commentary unless specifically requested.
After that, when you responded with your answer, you should respond with <finish></finish>.
Then finally, to exit, you can run <execute_bash>
exit()
</execute_bash>
obs - NullObservation(content='', observation='null')

Step 31:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: To calculate the optimal route using the `trip_service_GET` tool, I will use the coordinates of the three locations:

1. Carnegie Mellon University: 40.4441897, -79.9427192
2. Apple Store Shadyside: 40.4511693, -79.9334241
3. Starbucks on Craig Street: 40.4446025, -79.9485226

I will set the `source` parameter to 'first' to ensure the journey begins at Carnegie Mellon University.

Let's calculate the optimal route.
