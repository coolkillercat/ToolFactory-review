Step 4:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: To determine the duration required to first walk from Carnegie Mellon University to the Apple Store in Shadyside, and then drive to Starbucks on Craig Street, I will follow these steps:

1. List the available tools for the 'map' site to find the appropriate API for calculating travel durations.
2. Check the documentation for the relevant tools to understand the required parameters and usage.
3. Use the appropriate API calls to calculate the walking duration from Carnegie Mellon University to the Apple Store in Shadyside.
4. Use the appropriate API calls to calculate the driving duration from the Apple Store in Shadyside to Starbucks on Craig Street.
5. Sum the durations to get the total travel time.

Let's start by listing the available tools for the 'map' site.

list_tools(site='map')

Step 5:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: To calculate the travel durations, the `route_service_GET` tool seems appropriate for finding the fastest route between coordinates. Let's check the documentation for this tool to understand how to use it.
CODE:
from utils import get_documentation
get_documentation('route_service_GET', site='map')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
DEBUG: Looking for module at /workspace/api/map/tools/route_service_GET.py

Step 6:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `route_service_GET` tool allows us to find the fastest route between coordinates. We need to provide the coordinates in the format `{longitude},{latitude};{longitude},{latitude}`. Additionally, we can request annotations to get the duration of the route.

Let's proceed with the following steps:
1. Use the `route_service_GET` tool to calculate the walking duration from Carnegie Mellon University to the Apple Store in Shadyside.
2. Use the same tool to calculate the driving duration from the Apple Store in Shadyside to Starbucks on Craig Street.

First, I'll find the walking duration from Carnegie Mellon University to the Apple Store in Shadyside. I'll use the coordinates for these locations:
- Carnegie Mellon University: `-79.9425,40.4442`
- Apple Store Shadyside: `-79.9326,40.4515`

Let's make the API call for the walking route.
CODE:
from utils import call_function

# Coordinates for walking from Carnegie Mellon University to Apple Store Shadyside
coordinates_walk = "-79.9425,40.4442;-79.9326,40.4515"

# Call the route_service_GET for walking
response_walk = call_function('route_service_GET', site='map',
