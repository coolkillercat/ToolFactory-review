1. List the available tools for the 'map' site to understand what functionalities are available.
2. Check the documentation for relevant tools that can help find nearby hotels and calculate walking distances.
3. Use the appropriate API calls to find nearby hotels and calculate the walking distance to the Gardner Steel Conference Center.
