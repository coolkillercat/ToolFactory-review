Step 4:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: To find the zip code of Yale University, I will follow these steps:

1. List the available tools for the 'map' site to see what functionalities are available.
2. Check the documentation for any tool that might help in finding the location or zip code of a place.
3. Use the appropriate tool to find the zip code of Yale University.

Let's start by listing the available tools for the 'map' site.
CODE:
from utils import list_tools

Step 5:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: To find the zip code of Yale University, the `search_api_GET` tool seems to be the most relevant as it allows looking up a location from a textual description or address. 

Next, I'll check the documentation for the `search_api_GET` tool to understand how to use it effectively. Let's proceed with that step.
CODE:

get_documentation('search_api_GET', site='map')

Step 6:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `search_api_GET` tool allows us to search for locations using a free-form query or specific address components. To find the zip code of Yale University, I will use the `q` parameter with "Yale University" and request the output in JSON format with address details included.

Let's proceed with calling the `search_api_GET` function to find the zip code of Yale University.
CODE:
from utils import call_function

# Call the search_api_GET function to find Yale University's location details
result = call_function('search_api_GET', site='map', q='Yale University', format='json', addressdetails=1)
