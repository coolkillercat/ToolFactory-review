THOUGHT: The `search_api_GET` tool allows us to search for locations using various parameters. To find the nearest McDonald's, we can use the `q` parameter with a query like "McDonald's" and specify the location around CMU Pittsburgh using the `viewbox` parameter.

Next, I'll use the `search_api_GET` to find the nearest McDonald's to CMU Pittsburgh. Let's proceed with this step.

# Define a viewbox around CMU Pittsburgh

Step 9:

THOUGHT: It seems that the search did not return any results for McDonald's within the specified viewbox. This could be due to the viewbox being too restrictive. Let's try expanding the search area slightly to see if we can find a nearby McDonald's.

I'll adjust the viewbox to cover a larger area around CMU Pittsburgh and try the search again.
