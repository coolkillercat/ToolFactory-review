Step 23:
act - **MessageAction** (source=EventSource.AGENT)
CONTENT: The walking route from Randyland to Carnegie Mellon University has been successfully calculated. The duration is approximately 800.2 seconds, which is about 13.3 minutes, and the distance is approximately 8295.5 meters.

Next, let's calculate the driving route using the same `route_service_GET` tool. I'll proceed with that calculation.
obs - NullObservation(content='', observation='null')

Step 24:
act - **MessageAction** (source=EventSource.USER)
CONTENT: Please continue working on the task on whatever approach you think is suitable.

When you think you successfully finished the task, first respond with `Finish[answer]` where you include *only* your answer to the questionin `[]` if the user asks for an answer, make sure you should only include the answer to the question but not any additional explanation, details, or commentary unless specifically requested.
After that, when you responded with your answer, you should respond with <finish></finish>.
Then finally, to exit, you can run <execute_bash>
exit()
</execute_bash>
obs - NullObservation(content='', observation='null')

Step 25:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: Let's calculate the driving route from Randyland to Carnegie Mellon University using the `route_service_GET` tool. We'll use the same coordinates and see if the default mode is driving or if we need to adjust the parameters.
