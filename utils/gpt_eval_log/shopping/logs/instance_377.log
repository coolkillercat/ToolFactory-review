Step 4:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: To find restaurants around CMU ArtPark Lab, I will follow the API workflow:

1. List available tools for the 'map' site.
2. Check the documentation for any tool that can help find nearby restaurants.
3. Use the appropriate API call to get the information.

Let's start by listing the available tools for the 'map' site.
CODE:
from utils import list_tools
list_tools(site='map')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
DEBUG: Starting list_tools for site 'map'
DEBUG: Looking for tool descriptions at: /workspace/api/map/tool_descriptions.json

Step 5:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: To find restaurants around CMU ArtPark Lab, we need to identify a tool that can help us search for places or points of interest. The `search_api_GET` tool seems promising as it allows for location lookup from a textual description or address.

Let's check the documentation for the `search_api_GET` tool to understand how to use it for finding restaurants around CMU ArtPark Lab.
CODE:
from utils import get_documentation
get_documentation('search_api_GET', site='map')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
DEBUG: Looking for module at /workspace/api/map/tools/search_api_GET.py

Step 6:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `search_api_GET` tool allows us to search for places using various parameters, including amenities. To find restaurants around CMU ArtPark Lab, we can use the `amenity` parameter set to "restaurant" and provide the location details for CMU ArtPark Lab.

Let's proceed with calling the `search_api_GET` function to find restaurants around CMU ArtPark Lab.
CODE:
from utils import call_function

# Using the search_api_GET to find restaurants around CMU ArtPark Lab
result = call_function(
    'search_api_GET',
    site='map',
    q='CMU ArtPark Lab',
    amenity='restaurant',
    format='jsonv2',
    limit=10
)
result
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**

Step 7:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: It seems that the response from the API is not providing the expected JSON data for restaurants around CMU ArtPark Lab. The response is an HTML page, which indicates that the request might not have been processed as intended.

Let's try adjusting the query parameters to ensure we are correctly targeting the search for restaurants. I'll attempt a more specific query using the bounding box or city parameters to refine the search.

I'll make another attempt to find restaurants around CMU ArtPark Lab.
CODE:
# Attempting a refined search with additional parameters
result = call_function(
    'search_api_GET',
    site='map',
    q='CMU ArtPark Lab, Pittsburgh',
    amenity='restaurant',
    format='jsonv2',
    limit=10
)
result

parameter: q=CMU ArtPark Lab, Pittsburgh, amenity=restaurant, format=jsonv2, limit=10

Step 8:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: It appears that the API is still returning an HTML page instead of the expected JSON data. This might be due to incorrect usage of the API or a limitation in the API's ability to handle the specific query format.

To address this, I will try using a different approach by specifying a bounding box around CMU ArtPark Lab to search for restaurants. This method can help in narrowing down the search area more effectively.

Let's attempt this refined search using a bounding box.
CODE:
# Attempting a search using a bounding box around CMU ArtPark Lab
result = call_function(
    'search_api_GET',
    site='map',
    q='restaurant',
    viewbox='-79.945,40.443,-79.935,40.453',  # Example bounding box coordinates around CMU ArtPark Lab
    bounded=1,
    format='jsonv2',
    limit=10
)
result
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
tool: search_api_GET

parameter: q=restaurant, viewbox=-79.945,40.443,-79.935,40.453, bounded=1, format=jsonv2, limit=10
<Response [200]>

Step 9:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: It seems that the API is consistently returning an HTML page instead of the expected JSON data. This indicates that there might be an issue with how the API is being accessed or the parameters being used.

Given the current situation, it might be necessary to explore alternative methods or tools to achieve the desired result. However, based on the available tools, it seems that the `search_api_GET` is the most relevant for this task.

Since the current approach is not yielding the expected results, I will attempt a different strategy by using a more general search query without specifying the `amenity` parameter, focusing on the location and bounding box.

Let's try this approach.
CODE:
# Attempting a general search around CMU ArtPark Lab using a bounding box
result = call_function(
    'search_api_GET',
    site='map',
    q='CMU ArtPark Lab',
    viewbox='-79.945,40.443,-79.935,40.453',  # Example bounding box coordinates around CMU ArtPark Lab
    bounded=1,
    format='jsonv2',
    limit=10
