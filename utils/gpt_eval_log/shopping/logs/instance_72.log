Step 4:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: To find the zip code of Yale University, I will follow these steps:

1. List the available tools for the 'map' site to see if there is a tool that can help find location information.
2. Check the documentation for any relevant tool that can provide location details or zip codes.
3. Use the appropriate tool to find the zip code for Yale University.

Let's start by listing the available tools for the 'map' site.
CODE:
from utils import list_tools
list_tools(site='map')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
DEBUG: Starting list_tools for site 'map'
DEBUG: Looking for tool descriptions at: /workspace/api/map/tool_descriptions.json

Step 5:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The available tools for the 'map' site include a variety of APIs for querying location data. The most relevant tool for finding the zip code of Yale University seems to be the `search_api_GET`, which allows for location lookup from a textual description or address.

Next, I'll check the documentation for the `search_api_GET` tool to understand how to use it for our purpose.
CODE:
from utils import get_documentation
get_documentation('search_api_GET', site='map')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
DEBUG: Looking for module at /workspace/api/map/tools/search_api_GET.py

Step 6:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `search_api_GET` tool uses the Nominatim API to search for places based on various parameters, including a query string (`q`). It can return detailed address information, which should include the zip code.

I will use this tool to search for "Yale University" and retrieve its address details, including the zip code.

Let's proceed with calling the `search_api_GET` function to find the zip code for Yale University.
CODE:
from utils import call_function

# Call the search_api_GET to find Yale University's zip code
result = call_function('search_api_GET', site='map', q='Yale University', addressdetails=1, format='jsonv2', limit=1)
result

Step 7:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: It seems there was an issue with the response format. The response was not in the expected JSON format, which might be due to a misconfiguration or an issue with the API call.

Let's try to make the API call again, ensuring that the parameters are correctly set to receive a JSON response with address details.

I'll attempt the API call once more to retrieve the correct information.
CODE:
# Attempting the API call again with the correct parameters
result = call_function('search_api_GET', site='map', q='Yale University', addressdetails=1, format='json', limit=1)

parameter: q=Yale University, addressdetails=1, format=json, limit=1
<Response [200]>

Step 8:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: It appears that the response is still not in the expected JSON format. This might be due to an issue with the API endpoint or the way the request is being handled.

To troubleshoot, I'll try a different approach by using a more direct method to access the Nominatim API and ensure that the request is correctly formatted to return JSON data.

Let's attempt to directly query the Nominatim API using a different method to retrieve the zip code for Yale University.
CODE:
import requests

# Directly querying the Nominatim API for Yale University
response = requests.get(
    "https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/search",
    params={
        "q": "Yale University",
        "format": "json",
        "addressdetails": 1,
        "limit": 1
    }
)

# Check if the response is successful and print the result
if response.status_code == 200:
    data = response.json()
    if data:
        # Extracting the zip code from the address details
        address = data[0].get('address', {})
        zip_code = address.get('postcode', 'Zip code not found')
        zip_code
    else:
        "No data found"
else:
    f"Error: {response.status_code}"
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
[Code executed successfully with no output]

Step 9:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: It seems there was an issue with displaying the output. Let me try to print the result again to ensure we capture the zip code for Yale University correctly.

I'll attempt to retrieve and display the zip code once more.
CODE:
# Re-attempting to extract and print the zip code from the response
if response.status_code == 200:
    data = response.json()
    if data:
        # Extracting the zip code from the address details
        address = data[0].get('address', {})
        zip_code = address.get('postcode', 'Zip code not found')
        print(zip_code)
    else:
        print("No data found")
else:
    print(f"Error: {response.status_code}")
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
Error: 403


Step 10:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: It seems that the direct request to the Nominatim API resulted in a 403 Forbidden error, which indicates that the request was blocked, possibly due to rate limiting or other access restrictions.

Given this limitation, I will attempt to use another method to find the zip code for Yale University. I will try using a different API or approach to obtain this information.

Let's try using the `place_details_GET` tool, which might provide detailed information about a specific place, including its zip code. I'll first check the documentation for this tool.
CODE:
get_documentation('place_details_GET', site='map')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
