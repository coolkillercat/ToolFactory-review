Step 4:

Step 5:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: To find the operator of PIT airport, we should look for a tool that provides details about a specific place. The `place_details_GET` tool seems relevant for this task as it shows all details about a single place saved in the database. Let's check the documentation for this tool to understand how to use it.
CODE:
from utils import get_documentation
get_documentation('place_details_GET', site='map')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
DEBUG: Looking for module at /workspace/api/map/tools/place_details_GET.py

Step 6:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `place_details_GET` tool retrieves detailed information about a place using the Nominatim OpenStreetMap API. To find the operator of PIT airport, we need to know the OSM type and ID for the airport. 

Let's use the `search_api_GET` tool to look up the location of PIT airport and obtain the necessary details to use with `place_details_GET`. I'll check the documentation for `search_api_GET` to understand how to use it.
CODE:
get_documentation('search_api_GET', site='map')

Step 7:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `search_api_GET` tool allows us to search for places using the Nominatim API. We can use this tool to search for PIT airport by its name and obtain the necessary details such as the OSM type and ID.

Let's perform a search for "PIT airport" using the `search_api_GET` tool.
CODE:
from utils import call_function
result = call_function('search_api_GET', site='map', q='PIT airport', format='jsonv2', limit=1)
result
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**

Step 8:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: It seems there was an issue with retrieving the JSON response for the search query. The response returned an HTML page instead of the expected JSON data. This might be due to a misconfiguration or an issue with the API endpoint.

Let's try to adjust the parameters and ensure that we are correctly requesting the JSON format. I'll attempt the search again with a focus on ensuring the correct format is requested.
CODE:

Step 9:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: It seems that the API is still returning an HTML page instead of the expected JSON data. This could be due to a restriction or a misconfiguration in the API request.

To proceed, let's try using a different approach by searching for the airport using a more specific query or by using another tool that might provide the necessary details. I'll attempt to use the `place_details_GET` tool directly with a known OSM ID for PIT airport, if available.

First, let's try to find the OSM ID for PIT airport using a different method or tool. If we can't find it, we might need to explore other options or tools available. Let's try using the `search_for_notes_GET` tool to see if it can provide any relevant information.
CODE:
get_documentation('search_for_notes_GET', site='map')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
DEBUG: Looking for module at /workspace/api/map/tools/search_for_notes_GET.py
'"""\nReturns notes that match the specified query.\n\nParameters:\n- q: Text search query, matching either note text or comments.\n- limit: Maximum number of results.\n- closed: Maximum number of days a note has been closed for.\n- display_name: Search for notes which the given user interacted with.\n- user: Search based on user id instead of display name.\n- bbox: Search area.\n- from: Beginning date range for created_at or updated_at.\n- to: End date range for created_at or updated_at.\n- sort: Sort results by creation or update date.\n- order: Sorting order.\n""" example: search_for_notes('

Step 10:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `search_for_notes_GET` tool allows us to search for notes that match a specified query. However, this tool is primarily for searching notes and comments, which may not directly help us find the OSM ID for PIT airport.

Since the previous attempts to use the `search_api_GET` tool did not yield the expected results, let's try a different approach. We can attempt to use the `general_request_GET` tool to make a direct request to the Nominatim API with a more specific query to find the OSM ID for PIT airport.

I'll check the documentation for the `general_request_GET` tool to see if it can be used for this purpose.
CODE:
get_documentation('general_request_GET', site='map')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
DEBUG: Looking for module at /workspace/api/map/tools/general_request_GET.py
'"""\nMake a request to the OSRM API.\n\n    Args:\n        profile (str): The routing profile to use (e.g., \'car\', \'bike\', \'foot\').\n        service (str): The OSRM service to use (e.g., \'route\', \'nearest\', \'table\').\n        coordinates (str): Coordinates in the format \'lon1,lat1;lon2,lat2;...\'.\n        format (str): Response format (e.g., \'json\').\n        option (str): Additional options for the request.\n\n    Returns:\n        requests.Response: The response from the OSRM API.\n""" example: general_request('

Step 11:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `general_request_GET` tool is designed for making requests to the OSRM API, which is primarily used for routing and navigation services. It doesn't seem suitable for querying the Nominatim API directly for place details.

Given the challenges with the previous attempts, let's try a different approach by using the `search_api_GET` tool with a more specific query, such as "Pittsburgh International Airport" instead of "PIT airport," to see if that yields better results. This might help us obtain the OSM ID needed for further queries.

I'll attempt this search now.
CODE:
result = call_function('search_api_GET', site='map', q='Pittsburgh International Airport', format='json', limit=1, addressdetails=1)
result
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**

Step 12:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: It seems that the API is consistently returning an HTML page instead of the expected JSON data. This issue might be due to a restriction or a misconfiguration in the API request.

Given the current limitations, let's try a different approach by using the `place_details_GET` tool directly with a known OSM ID for PIT airport, if available. Since we are unable to retrieve the OSM ID through the search, we might need to explore other options or tools available.

Let's attempt to use the `place_details_GET` tool with a hypothetical OSM ID for demonstration purposes, as we are unable to retrieve it through the search. If this doesn't work, we may need to consider alternative methods or tools.
CODE:
# Attempting to use place_details_GET with a hypothetical OSM ID
result = call_function('place_details_GET', site='map', osmtype='W', osmid=123456, format='json', addressdetails=1)
result
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**

Step 13:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: It seems there was an error due to an incorrect parameter name. The `place_details_GET` tool does not accept a `format` parameter. Let's correct this and try again without the `format` parameter.

I'll attempt to call the `place_details_GET` tool again with the corrected parameters.
CODE:
