Step 26:
act - **MessageAction** (source=EventSource.AGENT)
CONTENT: It seems there is a persistent issue with the parameters for the `advanced_product_search_GET` function. Given the constraints and the time limit, I will attempt a final approach using a simplified parameter set to see if we can retrieve any results.

Let's try calling the function with a basic filter for price under $25, without additional parameters that might be causing issues.
obs - NullObservation(content='', observation='null')

Step 27:
act - **MessageAction** (source=EventSource.USER)
CONTENT: Please continue working on the task on whatever approach you think is suitable.

When you think you successfully finished the task, first respond with `Finish[answer]` where you include *only* your answer to the questionin `[]` if the user asks for an answer, make sure you should only include the answer to the question but not any additional explanation, details, or commentary unless specifically requested.
After that, when you responded with your answer, you should respond with <finish></finish>.
Then finally, to exit, you can run <execute_bash>
exit()
</execute_bash>
obs - NullObservation(content='', observation='null')

Step 28:
act - **CmdRunAction**
THOUGHT: I understand the urgency. Given the constraints and the time limit, I will attempt a final approach using a simplified parameter set to see if we can retrieve any results.

Let's try calling the function with a basic filter for price under $25, without additional parameters that might be causing issues.
