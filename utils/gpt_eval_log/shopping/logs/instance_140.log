- `geometries`: Format of the returned geometry (polyline, polyline6, geojson).

To proceed, I need to determine the coordinates for Niagara Falls and Yale University. Once I have these, I can call the `route_service_GET` function to estimate the driving time. Let's start by finding the coordinates for these locations.
