Step 6:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: To find the price range for products from Sephora, I need to identify the appropriate tool to search for products and retrieve their prices. Based on the available tools, the `get_product_list_GET` or `advanced_product_search_GET` seems relevant for retrieving a list of products with search criteria.

I'll start by checking the documentation for the `get_product_list_GET` tool to see if it allows searching by brand or name, which will help in finding Sephora products.

Let's proceed with examining the documentation for `get_product_list_GET`.
CODE:
from utils import get_documentation
get_documentation('get_product_list_GET', site='shopping')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
DEBUG: Looking for module at /workspace/api/shopping/tools/get_product_list_GET.py

Step 7:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `get_product_list_GET` tool allows us to filter products based on specific criteria, such as field, value, and condition type. This will be useful for searching products by brand name, such as "Sephora."

Next, I'll use this tool to search for products from Sephora and retrieve their prices. I'll then calculate the price range from the retrieved data.

Let's proceed with calling the `get_product_list_GET` function to search for Sephora products.
CODE:
from utils import call_function

    'get_product_list_GET',

    searchCriteria_pageSize=100,
    searchCriteria_currentPage=1
)

# Extract prices from the result
products = result.get('content', {}).get('items', [])
prices = [product.get('price') for product in products if product.get('price') is not None]

# Calculate the price range
price_range = (min(prices), max(prices)) if prices else (None, None)

Step 8:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: It seems there was an issue with the API call, specifically a missing or incorrect parameter related to `searchCriteria`. The error message indicates that a required field is missing.

I'll review the parameters and ensure they are correctly formatted and complete. Let's try to correct the API call and retrieve the product list again.

I'll adjust the parameters and make another attempt to call the `get_product_list_GET` function.
CODE:
# Correcting the API call with proper search criteria format
result = call_function(

AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'status_code'

Step 9:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: It seems there was an issue with how the result from the API call was handled. The `call_function` might be returning a string instead of a response object, which is why the `status_code` attribute is not available.

I'll adjust the code to handle the result correctly and extract the necessary information. Let's try to retrieve the product list and calculate the price range again.
CODE:
# Correcting the handling of the API response
result = call_function(
    'get_product_list_GET',
    site='shopping',
    searchCriteria='{"filterGroups":[{"filters":[{"field":"brand","value":"Sephora","conditionType":"eq"}]}],"pageSize":100,"currentPage":1}'

try:
    result_data = json.loads(result)
    products = result_data.get('items', [])
    prices = [product.get('price') for product in products if product.get('price') is not None]

    # Calculate the price range
    price_range = (min(prices), max(prices)) if prices else (None, None)
except json.JSONDecodeError:
    price_range = (None, None)

api_url: http://ec2-3-129-135-45.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:7770/rest/default/V1/products
(None, None)

Step 10:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: It seems that the API call did not return any products, resulting in a price range of `(None, None)`. This could be due to an incorrect field name or value in the search criteria.

I'll try using a different approach to ensure the field name and value are correct. Let's attempt to retrieve the product list again with a different field or value if necessary.

I'll try using a more general search or check for any available products from Sephora.
CODE:
# Attempting a more general search for products
result = call_function(
    'advanced_product_search_GET',
    site='shopping',
    searchCriteria='{"filterGroups":[{"filters":[{"field":"name","value":"Sephora","conditionType":"like"}]}],"pageSize":100,"currentPage":1}'
)

# Assuming result is a JSON string, parse it
try:
    result_data = json.loads(result)
    products = result_data.get('items', [])
    prices = [product.get('price') for product in products if product.get('price') is not None]

    # Calculate the price range
    price_range = (min(prices), max(prices)) if prices else (None, None)

tool: advanced_product_search_GET
site: shopping
parameter: searchCriteria={"filterGroups":[{"filters":[{"field":"name","value":"Sephora","conditionType":"like"}]}],"pageSize":100,"currentPage":1}
(None, None)

Step 11:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: It appears that the search is still not returning any products, resulting in a price range of `(None, None)`. This could be due to the search criteria not matching any products in the database.

To ensure that we are using the correct field and value, I'll try a different approach by checking if there are any other fields or methods to search for Sephora products. Let's explore the documentation for the `advanced_product_search_GET` tool to see if there are any additional options or fields we can use.

I'll proceed with examining the documentation for `advanced_product_search_GET`.
CODE:
get_documentation('advanced_product_search_GET', site='shopping')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
DEBUG: Looking for module at /workspace/api/shopping/tools/advanced_product_search_GET.py
"No documentation found for tool 'advanced_product_search_GET' in site 'shopping' example: advanced_product_search(searchCriteria_requestName_='''advanced_search_container''', searchCriteria_filterGroups__0__filters__0__field_='''price.from''', searchCriteria_filterGroups__0__filters__0__value_='''2''', searchCriteria_filterGroups__0__filters__1__field_='''price.to''', searchCriteria_filterGroups__0__filters__1__value_='''3''', searchCriteria_filterGroups__0__filters__0__condition_type_='''like''')"

Step 12:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: It seems there is no detailed documentation available for the `advanced_product_search_GET` tool, but there is an example provided. The example suggests using `searchCriteria_requestName` and filtering by price range.

Given the lack of documentation, I'll attempt to use the `get_product_list_GET` tool again, but this time I'll try a different approach by using a more general search term or checking for any available products from Sephora.

Let's try a more general search for products that might include Sephora in their name or description.
CODE:
# Attempting a more general search for products with a different approach
result = call_function(
    'get_product_list_GET',
    site='shopping',
    searchCriteria='{"filterGroups":[{"filters":[{"field":"name","value":"%Sephora%","conditionType":"like"}]}],"pageSize":100,"currentPage":1}'
)

# Assuming result is a JSON string, parse it
try:
    result_data = json.loads(result)
    products = result_data.get('items', [])
    prices = [product.get('price') for product in products if product.get('price') is not None]

    # Calculate the price range
    price_range = (min(prices), max(prices)) if prices else (None, None)

Step 13:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: It seems that the search is still not returning any products, resulting in a price range of `(None, None)`. This could be due to the search criteria not matching any products in the database or an issue with the API.

Given the constraints, I'll attempt a different approach by using a broader search term or checking for any available products from Sephora using a different field or method.

Let's try using the `get_product_list_GET` tool with a different field or value to see if we can retrieve any products.
CODE:
# Attempting a broader search for products with a different field
result = call_function(
    'get_product_list_GET',

THOUGHT: It seems that the search is still not returning any products, resulting in a price range of `(None, None)`. This could be due to the search criteria not matching any products in the database or an issue with the API.

Given the constraints and the remaining attempts, I'll try a different approach by using a more general search term or checking for any available products from Sephora using a different field or method.

Let's try using the `get_product_list_GET` tool with a different field or value to see if we can retrieve any products.
CODE:
# Attempting a broader search for products with a different field
result = call_function(
    'get_product_list_GET',
    site='shopping',
    searchCriteria='{"filterGroups":[{"filters":[{"field":"sku","value":"%Sephora%","conditionType":"like"}]}],"pageSize":100,"currentPage":1}'
)

# Assuming result is a JSON string, parse it
try:
    result_data = json.loads(result)
    products = result_data.get('items', [])
    prices = [product.get('price') for product in products if product.get('price') is not None]

    # Calculate the price range
    price_range = (min(prices), max(prices)) if prices else (None, None)
except json.JSONDecodeError:
    price_range = (None, None)
