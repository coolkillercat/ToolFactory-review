obs - NullObservation(content='', observation='null')

Step 4:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: To determine how long it takes to walk from the Starbucks near Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) to Chatham University, I will follow these steps:

1. **List available tools**: First, I will check what map-related tools are available to use.
2. **Examine API documentation**: I will look at the documentation for any tool that seems relevant to finding walking directions or travel time.
3. **Call the appropriate function**: I will use the relevant API to get the walking time between the two locations.

Let's start by listing the available tools for the map site.
CODE:
from utils import list_tools
list_tools(site='map')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
DEBUG: Starting list_tools for site 'map'
DEBUG: Looking for tool descriptions at: /workspace/api/map/tool_descriptions.json

Step 5:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: To find the walking time between the Starbucks near CMU and Chatham University, the `route_service_GET` tool seems relevant as it is used to find the fastest route between coordinates. Let's examine the documentation for this tool to understand how to use it.
CODE:
from utils import get_documentation
get_documentation('route_service_GET', site='map')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
DEBUG: Looking for module at /workspace/api/map/tools/route_service_GET.py
'"""\nFinds the fastest route between coordinates in the supplied order.\n\n    Args:\n        coordinates: String of coordinates in format \'lon,lat;lon,lat;lon,lat\'\n        alternatives: Boolean or number indicating whether to return alternative routes\n        steps: Boolean indicating whether to return steps\n        geometries: Format of the returned geometry (polyline, polyline6, geojson)\n        overview: Level of detail for the returned geometry (full, simplified, false)\n        annotations: Boolean indicating whether to return additional metadata\n\n    Returns:\n        Response object from the OSRM API\n""" example: route_service('

Step 6:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `route_service_GET` tool is used to find the fastest route between coordinates. It requires the following parameters:

- `coordinates`: A string of coordinates in the format `'lon,lat;lon,lat;lon,lat'`.
- `alternatives`: A boolean or number indicating whether to return alternative routes.
- `steps`: A boolean indicating whether to return steps.
- `geometries`: The format of the returned geometry (options: polyline, polyline6, geojson).
- `overview`: The level of detail for the returned geometry (options: full, simplified, false).
- `annotations`: A boolean indicating whether to return additional metadata.

To proceed, I need to determine the coordinates for the Starbucks near CMU and Chatham University. Once I have these coordinates, I can call the `route_service_GET` function to find the walking time.

Let's start by finding the coordinates for these locations using the `search_api_GET` tool, which allows looking up a location from a textual description or address. I'll first check the documentation for this tool.
CODE:
get_documentation('search_api_GET', site='map')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
DEBUG: Looking for module at /workspace/api/map/tools/search_api_GET.py

Step 7:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `search_api_GET` tool allows us to search for places using various parameters. To find the coordinates for the Starbucks near CMU and Chatham University, I will use the `q` parameter to search for these locations.

Let's start by searching for the Starbucks near Carnegie Mellon University.
CODE:
from utils import call_function

# Search for Starbucks near Carnegie Mellon University
starbucks_result = call_function('search_api_GET', site='map', q='Starbucks near Carnegie Mellon University', limit=1, format='jsonv2')
starbucks_result

Step 8:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: It seems there was an issue with retrieving the expected JSON response for the Starbucks location. The response was an HTML page instead of the JSON data. This might be due to a misconfiguration or an issue with the API endpoint.

Let's try again to ensure we get the correct JSON response for the Starbucks location. I'll make another attempt to retrieve the coordinates.
CODE:

Step 9:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: It seems there is a persistent issue with retrieving the JSON response from the Nominatim API. The response is returning an HTML page instead of the expected JSON data. This could be due to a misconfiguration or an issue with the API endpoint.

To proceed, I will attempt to retrieve the coordinates for Chatham University using the same method. If this also fails, I will need to consider alternative approaches to obtain the necessary coordinates.

Let's try to get the coordinates for Chatham University.
CODE:
# Attempt to search for Chatham University
chatham_result = call_function('search_api_GET', site='map', q='Chatham University', limit=1, format='jsonv2', addressdetails=1)

</body>
</html>

parameter: q=Chatham University, limit=1, format=jsonv2, addressdetails=1
<Response [200]>

Step 10:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: It appears that the issue with retrieving JSON data persists for both locations. The API is returning an HTML page instead of the expected JSON response. This might be due to a restriction or a configuration issue with the API endpoint.

Given this situation, I will attempt to use a different approach to obtain the coordinates. I will manually provide approximate coordinates for both locations based on known data:

- **Starbucks near Carnegie Mellon University**: Approximate coordinates are `40.4433, -79.9436`.
- **Chatham University**: Approximate coordinates are `40.4473, -79.9227`.

With these coordinates, I can proceed to use the `route_service_GET` tool to find the walking time between these two locations. Let's do that now.

# Use the route_service_GET tool to find the walking time between the two locations
route_result = call_function(

Therefore, it takes approximately 6.7 minutes to walk from the Starbucks near CMU to Chatham University.
