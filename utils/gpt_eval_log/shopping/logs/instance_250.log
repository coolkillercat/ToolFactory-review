Step 4:

1. List the available tools for the 'map' site to see what functionalities are available.
2. Check the documentation for any tool that might help in finding locations or coordinates.
3. Use the appropriate tool to search for the Apple Store near Pitt and retrieve its coordinates.

Let's start by listing the available tools for the 'map' site.

Step 5:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: To find the coordinates of the Apple Store near Pitt, the `search_api_GET` tool seems appropriate as it allows for location lookup from a textual description or address. Let's check the documentation for this tool to understand how to use it.
CODE:
from utils import get_documentation
get_documentation('search_api_GET', site='map')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**

Step 6:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `search_api_GET` tool allows us to search for places using various parameters. To find the Apple Store near Pitt, we can use the `q` parameter to specify the query string and possibly include additional parameters like `city` or `state` to narrow down the search.

Let's proceed by calling this API with a query for "Apple Store" near "Pitt" and see if we can retrieve the coordinates.
CODE:
from utils import call_function

# Search for the Apple Store near Pitt
result = call_function('search_api_GET', site='map', q='Apple Store Pitt', format='jsonv2', limit=1)
result

Step 7:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: It seems that the response from the API is not in the expected JSON format, and instead, it returned an HTML page. This might be due to an incorrect API endpoint or parameters.

Let's try adjusting the parameters or the query to ensure we get the correct JSON response. I'll attempt another call with a more specific query and ensure the format is set to JSON.
CODE:
# Attempting another call with a more specific query
result = call_function('search_api_GET', site='map', q='Apple Store, Pittsburgh', format='jsonv2', limit=1)

parameter: q=Apple Store, Pittsburgh, format=jsonv2, limit=1
<Response [200]>

Step 8:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: It appears that the API is still returning an HTML page instead of the expected JSON response. This might be due to an issue with the API endpoint or the way the request is being handled.

Let's try a different approach by using the `nearest_service_GET` tool, which might help in finding the nearest location based on coordinates. First, I'll check the documentation for this tool to see if it can be used to find the nearest Apple Store.
CODE:
get_documentation('nearest_service_GET', site='map')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
DEBUG: Looking for module at /workspace/api/map/tools/nearest_service_GET.py
'"""\nSnaps a coordinate to the street network and returns the nearest n matches.\n\nParameters:\n- coordinates: A single {longitude},{latitude} entry.\n- number: Number of nearest segments that should be returned.\n""" example: nearest_service(coordinates="""13.388860,52.517037""", number=3)'

Step 9:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `nearest_service_GET` tool is designed to snap a coordinate to the street network and return the nearest matches. However, it requires a specific coordinate to start with, which we don't have yet.

Since the previous attempts to use the `search_api_GET` tool did not yield the expected results, let's try a different approach. I will attempt to use the `place_details_GET` tool to see if it can provide details about a specific place, which might include coordinates.

First, I'll check the documentation for the `place_details_GET` tool to understand its usage.
CODE:
get_documentation('place_details_GET', site='map')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
DEBUG: Looking for module at /workspace/api/map/tools/place_details_GET.py

Step 10:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `place_details_GET` tool retrieves detailed information about a place using parameters like `osmtype`, `osmid`, or `place_id`. However, to use this tool, we need specific identifiers for the place, which we currently do not have.

Given the challenges with the previous attempts, let's try using the `search_api_GET` tool again, but this time with a different approach. I'll attempt to use a more general query and ensure the request is correctly formatted to retrieve JSON data.

Let's try searching for "Apple Store" in "Pittsburgh" again, but with a focus on ensuring the request is properly handled.
CODE:
# Attempting another call with a more general query
result = call_function('search_api_GET', site='map', q='Apple Store Pittsburgh', format='json', limit=1)

Step 11:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: It seems that the API is consistently returning an HTML page instead of the expected JSON response. This indicates that there might be an issue with the API endpoint or the way the request is being processed.

Given the current situation, let's try using the `general_request_GET` tool to make a more direct HTTP request to the Nominatim API, ensuring that the request is properly formatted to retrieve JSON data.

I'll check the documentation for the `general_request_GET` tool to understand how to use it for making a direct request.
CODE:

obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**

Step 12:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `general_request_GET` tool is designed for making requests to the OSRM API, which is primarily used for routing and navigation services. It might not be directly applicable for querying the Nominatim API for place details.

Given the challenges with the previous attempts, let's try a different approach by using the `search_api_GET` tool with a more specific query and ensuring the request is correctly formatted to retrieve JSON data. I'll attempt to use a more specific query for "Apple Store" in "Pittsburgh" and ensure the request is properly handled.

Let's try searching for "Apple Store" in "Pittsburgh" again, but with a focus on ensuring the request is properly formatted.

Step 13:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: It seems that the API is still returning an HTML page instead of the expected JSON response. This indicates that there might be an issue with the API endpoint or the way the request is being processed.

Given the consistent issue with the `search_api_GET` tool, let's try using the `search_for_notes_GET` tool to see if it can provide any relevant information about the Apple Store near Pitt. First, I'll check the documentation for this tool to understand its usage.
CODE:

Step 14:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `search_for_notes_GET` tool is used to search for notes based on a text query or other criteria. However, it is primarily designed for searching notes and comments, not for finding specific locations or coordinates.

Given the consistent issues with retrieving the expected JSON response from the `search_api_GET` tool, it seems there might be a persistent problem with the API endpoint or the request handling.

Since the current approach is not yielding the desired results, I will attempt to make a direct HTTP request to the Nominatim API using Python's `requests` library to see if we can retrieve the coordinates for the Apple Store in Pittsburgh.

Let's proceed with this approach.
CODE:
import requests

# Making a direct request to the Nominatim API
response = requests.get(

# Check if the response is successful and contains JSON data
if response.status_code == 200:
    data = response.json()
    if data:
        # Extracting the coordinates
        latitude = data[0].get('lat')
        longitude = data[0].get('lon')
        coordinates = (latitude, longitude)
    else:
        coordinates = "No data found"
else:
    coordinates = "Request failed"
