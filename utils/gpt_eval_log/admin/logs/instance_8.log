Step 4:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: To find the full address of all international airports within a driving distance of 5 km to Carnegie Mellon University, I will follow these steps:

1. List available tools for the 'map' site to find relevant APIs.
2. Check the documentation for tools that can help find airports and calculate distances.
3. Use the appropriate API to find international airports near Carnegie Mellon University.
4. Filter the results to those within a 5 km driving distance.
5. Retrieve and display the full addresses of these airports.

Let's start by listing the available tools for the 'map' site.
CODE:
from utils import list_tools
list_tools(site='map')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
DEBUG: Starting list_tools for site 'map'
DEBUG: Looking for tool descriptions at: /workspace/api/map/tool_descriptions.json

Step 5:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: To find international airports near Carnegie Mellon University, we need to use tools that can help us search for locations and calculate distances. Based on the available tools, the following might be useful:

- `search_api_GET`: To look up locations from a textual description or address.
- `route_service_GET`: To find the fastest route between coordinates, which can help in calculating driving distances.
- `nearest_service_GET`: To snap a coordinate to the street network and find nearby locations.

First, I'll check the documentation for the `search_api_GET` tool to see how we can use it to find airports near Carnegie Mellon University.
CODE:
from utils import get_documentation
get_documentation('search_api_GET', site='map')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
DEBUG: Looking for module at /workspace/api/map/tools/search_api_GET.py

Step 6:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `search_api_GET` tool allows us to search for places using various parameters, including query strings and specific amenities. We can use this tool to search for airports near Carnegie Mellon University.

Next, I'll check the documentation for the `route_service_GET` tool to understand how we can calculate driving distances between locations.
CODE:
get_documentation('route_service_GET', site='map')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
DEBUG: Looking for module at /workspace/api/map/tools/route_service_GET.py
'"""\nFinds the fastest route between coordinates in the supplied order.\n\n    Args:\n        coordinates: String of coordinates in format \'lon,lat;lon,lat;lon,lat\'\n        alternatives: Boolean or number indicating whether to return alternative routes\n        steps: Boolean indicating whether to return steps\n        geometries: Format of the returned geometry (polyline, polyline6, geojson)\n        overview: Level of detail for the returned geometry (full, simplified, false)\n        annotations: Boolean indicating whether to return additional metadata\n\n    Returns:\n        Response object from the OSRM API\n""" example: route_service('

Step 7:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `route_service_GET` tool helps find the fastest route between coordinates, which is useful for calculating driving distances. We can use this tool to determine if an airport is within a 5 km driving distance from Carnegie Mellon University.

Now, let's proceed with the following steps:
1. Use the `search_api_GET` to find airports near Carnegie Mellon University.
2. Use the `route_service_GET` to calculate the driving distance from Carnegie Mellon University to each airport found.
3. Filter the airports to those within a 5 km driving distance and retrieve their full addresses.

First, I'll use the `search_api_GET` to find airports near Carnegie Mellon University.
CODE:
from utils import call_function

I'll attempt to call the `search_api_GET` again with a slightly different configuration to ensure we receive the JSON response correctly.

Step 9:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: It seems that the response is still not providing the expected JSON data. This might be due to an issue with the API call or the configuration. Let's try using a different approach to ensure we get the correct data.

I'll attempt to use the `nearest_service_GET` tool to find the nearest airports to Carnegie Mellon University, which might provide a more direct way to get the required information.
CODE:
get_documentation('nearest_service_GET', site='map')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
DEBUG: Looking for module at /workspace/api/map/tools/nearest_service_GET.py

Step 10:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `nearest_service_GET` tool can be used to find the nearest locations to a given coordinate. However, it is primarily designed to snap a coordinate to the street network and return the nearest segments, which may not directly help in finding airports.

Given the challenges with the previous attempts, let's try using the `search_api_GET` tool again, but this time, I'll ensure that the request is correctly formatted and attempt to retrieve the JSON data directly.

I'll make another attempt to call the `search_api_GET` tool to find airports near Carnegie Mellon University.

<Response [200]>

Step 15:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: It seems that the response is still not providing the expected JSON data. This might be due to an issue with the API call or the configuration. Let's try using a different approach to ensure we get the correct data.

I'll attempt to use the `nearest_service_GET` tool to find the nearest airports to Carnegie Mellon University, which might provide a more direct way to get the required information.
CODE:
get_documentation('nearest_service_GET', site='map')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
DEBUG: Looking for module at /workspace/api/map/tools/nearest_service_GET.py
'"""\nSnaps a coordinate to the street network and returns the nearest n matches.\n\nParameters:\n- coordinates: A single {longitude},{latitude} entry.\n- number: Number of nearest segments that should be returned.\n""" example: nearest_service(coordinates="""13.388860,52.517037""", number=3)'

Step 16:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `nearest_service_GET` tool is designed to snap a coordinate to the street network and return the nearest segments, which may not directly help in finding airports. However, given the challenges with the previous attempts, let's try using the `search_api_GET` tool again, but this time, I'll ensure that the request is correctly formatted and attempt to retrieve the JSON data directly.

I'll make another attempt to call the `search_api_GET` tool to find airports near Carnegie Mellon University.
CODE:
# Attempting to call the search API again with a different configuration
search_results = call_function(
    'search_api_GET',
    site='map',
    q='airport',
    format='json',
    limit=10,
    addressdetails=1,
    viewbox='-80.0,40.5,-79.5,40.0',  # Approximate bounding box around Pittsburgh
    bounded=1
)
