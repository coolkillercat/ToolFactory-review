Step 4:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: To find the hours of operation for the Tokyo Japanese Food Store in Pittsburgh, I will follow the API workflow for the map site. Let's start by listing the available tools for the map site.
CODE:

list_tools(site='map')

Step 5:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: To find the hours of operation for the Tokyo Japanese Food Store in Pittsburgh, we need to use an appropriate tool from the list. The `place_details_GET` tool seems relevant as it shows all details about a single place saved in the database. Let's check the documentation for this tool to understand how to use it.
CODE:
from utils import get_documentation
get_documentation('place_details_GET', site='map')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
DEBUG: Looking for module at /workspace/api/map/tools/place_details_GET.py
'"""\nRetrieves detailed information about a place from the Nominatim OpenStreetMap API.\n\n    Parameters:\n    - osmtype: OSM type (N, W, R for node, way, relation)\n    - osmid: OSM ID of the object\n    - class_: Class of the object\n    - place_id: Place ID\n    - json_callback: Wraps the return in a JavaScript callback function\n    - pretty: Returns formatted JSON\n    - addressdetails: Include address details in the response\n    - keywords: Include keyword information\n    - linkedplaces: Include linked places\n    - hierarchy: Include place hierarchy\n    - group_hierarchy: Group hierarchy results\n    - polygon_geojson: Return geometry as GeoJSON\n    - accept_language: Preferred language for results\n""" example: place_details('

Step 6:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `place_details_GET` tool retrieves detailed information about a place using the Nominatim OpenStreetMap API. To use this tool, we need specific parameters such as `osmtype`, `osmid`, or `place_id`. 

To proceed, we need to first find the OSM ID or place ID for the Tokyo Japanese Food Store in Pittsburgh. We can use the `search_api_GET` tool to look up the location by name and get the necessary identifiers. Let's check the documentation for the `search_api_GET` tool to understand how to use it for our search.
CODE:
get_documentation('search_api_GET', site='map')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
DEBUG: Looking for module at /workspace/api/map/tools/search_api_GET.py

Step 7:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `search_api_GET` tool allows us to search for places using various parameters. We can use the `q` parameter to search for the "Tokyo Japanese Food Store" in Pittsburgh. Let's perform this search to find the necessary identifiers for the store.
CODE:
from utils import call_function
# Search for Tokyo Japanese Food Store in Pittsburgh
search_results = call_function('search_api_GET', site='map', q='Tokyo Japanese Food Store', city='Pittsburgh', format='jsonv2', limit=1, addressdetails=True)

Step 8:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: It seems there was an issue with retrieving the search results. The response did not contain the expected JSON data. Let's try the search again, ensuring that we correctly handle the response to extract the necessary identifiers for the Tokyo Japanese Food Store in Pittsburgh.
CODE:
# Retry the search for Tokyo Japanese Food Store in Pittsburgh

Step 9:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: It seems that the search is not returning the expected JSON data, and instead, we are receiving an HTML response. This might be due to an issue with the API endpoint or the parameters used.

Let's try a different approach by using the `search_api_GET` tool with a more general query to see if we can retrieve any relevant data for places in Pittsburgh. This might help us identify the correct parameters or approach to use.
CODE:
# General search for places in Pittsburgh to identify correct parameters
general_search_results = call_function('search_api_GET', site='map', q='Pittsburgh', format='jsonv2', limit=5, addressdetails=True, extratags=True)
general_search_results

</html>

parameter: q=Pittsburgh, format=jsonv2, limit=5, addressdetails=True, extratags=True
<Response [200]>

Step 10:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: It appears that the API is consistently returning an HTML response instead of the expected JSON data. This might indicate an issue with the API endpoint or the way requests are being handled.

Given this situation, I will attempt to use a different approach to find the hours of operation for the Tokyo Japanese Food Store in Pittsburgh. I will try using the `place_details_GET` tool with a general search for places in Pittsburgh to see if we can retrieve any relevant data.

Let's proceed with this approach.
CODE:
# Attempt to retrieve place details for a general location in Pittsburgh
place_details_results = call_function('place_details_GET', site='map', place_id='123456', addressdetails=True, extratags=True)
place_details_results
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
tool: place_details_GET
site: map
parameter: place_id=123456, addressdetails=True, extratags=True
api_url: https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/details
'Error calling function \'place_details_GET\': place_details() got an unexpected keyword argument \'extratags\'\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File "/workspace/utils.py", line 485, in call_function\n    result = target_function(**kwargs)\nTypeError: place_details() got an unexpected keyword argument \'extratags\'\n'

Step 11:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: It seems there was an error due to the use of an incorrect parameter (`extratags`) with the `place_details_GET` tool. Let's correct this and try again without the `extratags` parameter.

However, since we don't have the correct `place_id` for the Tokyo Japanese Food Store, we need to find a way to obtain it. Unfortunately, the previous attempts to use the `search_api_GET` tool did not yield the expected results.

Given the constraints, let's try a different approach by using the `search_for_notes_GET` tool to see if we can find any notes related to the Tokyo Japanese Food Store in Pittsburgh. This might provide us with some useful information.
CODE:
# Attempt to search for notes related to Tokyo Japanese Food Store in Pittsburgh
notes_search_results = call_function('search_for_notes_GET', site='map', q='Tokyo Japanese Food Store Pittsburgh', limit=5)
notes_search_results
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
