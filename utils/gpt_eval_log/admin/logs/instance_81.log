Step 4:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: To determine the duration required to first walk from the University of Pittsburgh to Starbucks on Craig Street, and then drive to Pittsburgh International Airport, I will follow these steps:

1. List the available tools for the map site to understand what APIs are available.
2. Check the documentation for relevant tools to find the ones that can provide walking and driving directions.
3. Use the appropriate API calls to get the walking duration from the University of Pittsburgh to Starbucks on Craig Street.
4. Use the appropriate API calls to get the driving duration from Starbucks on Craig Street to Pittsburgh International Airport.
5. Sum the durations to get the total time required for the journey.

Let's start by listing the available tools for the map site.

Let's first check the documentation for the `route_service_GET` tool to understand how to use it for walking and driving directions. I'll proceed with that now.

Step 8:
act - **MessageAction** (source=EventSource.AGENT)
CONTENT: The `route_service_GET` tool allows us to find the fastest route between coordinates. It requires the following parameters:

- `alternatives`: Boolean or number indicating whether to return alternative routes.
- `steps`: Boolean indicating whether to return steps.
- `geometries`: Format of the returned geometry (polyline, polyline6, geojson).
- `overview`: Level of detail for the returned geometry (full, simplified, false).
- `annotations`: Boolean indicating whether to return additional metadata.

To calculate the walking and driving durations, we need the coordinates for the University of Pittsburgh, Starbucks on Craig Street, and Pittsburgh International Airport. Let's proceed with finding these coordinates and then use the `route_service_GET` tool to calculate the durations. 

First, I'll find the coordinates for these locations using the `search_api_GET` tool. Let's start with the University of Pittsburgh.
