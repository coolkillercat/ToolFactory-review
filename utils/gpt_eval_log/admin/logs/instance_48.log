Step 22:
act - **MessageAction** (source=EventSource.AGENT)

Let's try calling the `list_orders_GET` function again with a more straightforward parameter setup.

Step 23:
act - **MessageAction** (source=EventSource.USER)
CONTENT: Please continue working on the task on whatever approach you think is suitable.

When you think you successfully finished the task, first respond with `Finish[answer]` where you include *only* your answer to the questionin `[]` if the user asks for an answer, make sure you should only include the answer to the question but not any additional explanation, details, or commentary unless specifically requested.
After that, when you responded with your answer, you should respond with <finish></finish>.
Then finally, to exit, you can run <execute_bash>
exit()

Step 24:

THOUGHT: I'll attempt a more straightforward approach by focusing on a single filter group for both the status and date range. Let's try calling the `list_orders_GET` function again with this setup.

Step 25:
act - **MessageAction** (source=EventSource.AGENT)
CONTENT: It seems there is a persistent issue with the parameter structure. I will attempt a final approach by simplifying the filter criteria to focus on the status and a single date range filter.

Let's try calling the `list_orders_GET` function one last time with this setup.

Step 26:
act - **MessageAction** (source=EventSource.USER)

Step 27:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: I will attempt a final approach by focusing on the status and a single date range filter using a different method to ensure the parameters are correctly structured.

Let's try calling the `list_orders_GET` function with this setup.
CODE:
# Attempt a final approach with a different method
orders_response = call_function(
    'list_orders_GET',
    site='shopping',
    searchCriteria_filterGroups=[
        {
            "filters": [
                {

    ],
    searchCriteria_sortOrders=[

            "field": "created_at",
            "direction": "ASC"
        }
    ],
    searchCriteria_pageSize=100,
    searchCriteria_currentPage=1
)

orders_response

Step 28:
act - **CmdRunAction**
THOUGHT: It seems that the parameter structure is not compatible with the API function as expected. Unfortunately, I have exhausted the attempts to resolve this issue within the current constraints.

I will now exit the session as instructed.
COMMAND:
exit()
obs - **CmdOutputObservation (exit code=-1)**
Command: "exit()" timed out. Sent SIGINT to the process:
