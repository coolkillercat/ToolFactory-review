Step 10:
act - **MessageAction** (source=EventSource.AGENT)
CONTENT: The `route_service_GET` tool allows us to find the fastest route between coordinates. It requires the following parameters:

- `coordinates`: A string of coordinates in the format 'lon,lat;lon,lat;lon,lat'.
- `alternatives`: Boolean or number indicating whether to return alternative routes.
- `steps`: Boolean indicating whether to return steps.
- `geometries`: Format of the returned geometry (polyline, polyline6, geojson).
- `overview`: Level of detail for the returned geometry (full, simplified, false).
- `annotations`: Boolean indicating whether to return additional metadata.

To calculate the walking time, we need the coordinates for Carnegie Museum of Art and a library at CMU. Let's assume the following coordinates for these locations:

- Carnegie Museum of Art: Longitude: -79.9489, Latitude: 40.4435
- CMU Library: Longitude: -79.9425, Latitude: 40.4428

Now, I'll call the `route_service_GET` function to get the walking route and time.
