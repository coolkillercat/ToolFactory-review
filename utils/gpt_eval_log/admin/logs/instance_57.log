Step 4:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: To find the closest restaurant(s) to the university center at Carnegie Mellon University, I will follow these steps:

1. List the available tools for the 'map' site to see what functionalities are available.
2. Check the documentation for any tool that seems relevant to finding nearby restaurants.
3. Use the appropriate API call to get the closest restaurant(s) to the specified location.

Let's start by listing the available tools for the 'map' site.
CODE:
from utils import list_tools
list_tools(site='map')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
DEBUG: Starting list_tools for site 'map'
DEBUG: Looking for tool descriptions at: /workspace/api/map/tool_descriptions.json

Step 5:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: To find the closest restaurant(s) to the university center at Carnegie Mellon University, the `nearest_service_GET` tool seems relevant as it can snap a coordinate to the street network and return the nearest matches. 

Next, I will check the documentation for the `nearest_service_GET` tool to understand how to use it effectively. Let's proceed with that.
CODE:
from utils import get_documentation
get_documentation('nearest_service_GET', site='map')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
DEBUG: Looking for module at /workspace/api/map/tools/nearest_service_GET.py
'"""\nSnaps a coordinate to the street network and returns the nearest n matches.\n\nParameters:\n- coordinates: A single {longitude},{latitude} entry.\n- number: Number of nearest segments that should be returned.\n""" example: nearest_service(coordinates="""13.388860,52.517037""", number=3)'

Step 6:
act - **MessageAction** (source=EventSource.AGENT)
CONTENT: The `nearest_service_GET` tool allows us to snap a coordinate to the street network and return the nearest matches. It requires the following parameters:

- `coordinates`: A single entry in the format `{longitude},{latitude}`.
- `number`: The number of nearest segments that should be returned.

To find the closest restaurants to the university center at Carnegie Mellon University, we need the coordinates of the university center. Once we have that, we can use the `nearest_service_GET` tool to find the nearest locations.

Let's proceed by using the `nearest_service_GET` tool with the coordinates for the university center at Carnegie Mellon University. I'll look up the coordinates and then make the API call.
obs - NullObservation(content='', observation='null')

Step 7:
act - **MessageAction** (source=EventSource.USER)
CONTENT: Please continue working on the task on whatever approach you think is suitable.

When you think you successfully finished the task, first respond with `Finish[answer]` where you include *only* your answer to the questionin `[]` if the user asks for an answer, make sure you should only include the answer to the question but not any additional explanation, details, or commentary unless specifically requested.
After that, when you responded with your answer, you should respond with <finish></finish>.
Then finally, to exit, you can run <execute_bash>
exit()
</execute_bash>
obs - NullObservation(content='', observation='null')

Step 8:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: To find the closest restaurants to the university center at Carnegie Mellon University, I'll first determine the coordinates of the university center. Then, I'll use the `nearest_service_GET` tool to find the nearest locations.

The coordinates for the university center at Carnegie Mellon University are approximately:
- Latitude: 40.4433
- Longitude: -79.9436

Now, I'll use these coordinates with the `nearest_service_GET` tool to find the nearest restaurants. Let's proceed with the API call.
CODE:
from utils import call_function

# Coordinates for the university center at Carnegie Mellon University
coordinates = "-79.9436,40.4433"
number_of_matches = 5  # Let's find the 5 nearest locations

# Call the nearest_service_GET tool
result = call_function('nearest_service_GET', site='map', coordinates=coordinates, number=number_of_matches)

Step 9:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: It seems there was an issue with the coordinates used in the API call, as the returned locations are not near Carnegie Mellon University. The coordinates appear to be incorrect, leading to results that are far from the intended location.

Let's correct the coordinates and try again. The correct coordinates for the university center at Carnegie Mellon University are approximately:
- Latitude: 40.4433
- Longitude: -79.9436

I'll make another API call with these corrected coordinates to find the nearest restaurants.

corrected_coordinates = "-79.9436,40.4433"

# Call the nearest_service_GET tool again with corrected coordinates
