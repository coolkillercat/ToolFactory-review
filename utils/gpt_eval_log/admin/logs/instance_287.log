Step 4:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: To determine the travel time from Pittsburgh to Philadelphia by car, I will follow these steps:

1. List the available tools for the 'map' site to find the appropriate API for travel time or distance calculation.
2. Examine the documentation for the relevant tool to understand the required parameters and usage.
3. Call the function with the necessary parameters to get the travel time.

Let's start by listing the available tools for the 'map' site.
CODE:
from utils import list_tools
list_tools(site='map')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
DEBUG: Starting list_tools for site 'map'
DEBUG: Looking for tool descriptions at: /workspace/api/map/tool_descriptions.json
DEBUG: File exists: True
DEBUG: Successfully read tool_descriptions.json

Step 5:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The tool that seems most relevant for finding the travel time between two locations is the `route_service_GET`, which is likely used to find the fastest route between coordinates. Let's examine the documentation for this tool to understand how to use it.
CODE:
from utils import get_documentation
get_documentation('route_service_GET', site='map')
obs - **IPythonRunCellObservation**
DEBUG: Looking for module at /workspace/api/map/tools/route_service_GET.py
'"""\nFinds the fastest route between coordinates in the supplied order.\n\n    Args:\n        coordinates: String of coordinates in format \'lon,lat;lon,lat;lon,lat\'\n        alternatives: Boolean or number indicating whether to return alternative routes\n        steps: Boolean indicating whether to return steps\n        geometries: Format of the returned geometry (polyline, polyline6, geojson)\n        overview: Level of detail for the returned geometry (full, simplified, false)\n        annotations: Boolean indicating whether to return additional metadata\n\n    Returns:\n        Response object from the OSRM API\n""" example: route_service('

Step 6:
act - **IPythonRunCellAction**
THOUGHT: The `route_service_GET` tool is used to find the fastest route between coordinates. It requires the following parameters:

- `coordinates`: A string of coordinates in the format `'lon,lat;lon,lat;lon,lat'`.
- `alternatives`: A boolean or number indicating whether to return alternative routes.
- `steps`: A boolean indicating whether to return steps.
- `geometries`: The format of the returned geometry (e.g., polyline, polyline6, geojson).
- `overview`: The level of detail for the returned geometry (e.g., full, simplified, false).
- `annotations`: A boolean indicating whether to return additional metadata.

To find the travel time from Pittsburgh to Philadelphia, I need to provide the coordinates for both cities. Let's proceed with calling the function using the coordinates for Pittsburgh and Philadelphia.

Coordinates:
- Pittsburgh: `-80.0000,40.4406`
- Philadelphia: `-75.1652,39.9526`

I'll call the function with these coordinates and the necessary parameters.
CODE:
from utils import call_function

# Coordinates for Pittsburgh and Philadelphia
coordinates = '-80.0000,40.4406;-75.1652,39.9526'

# Call the route_service_GET function
result = call_function('route_service_GET', site='map',
                       coordinates=coordinates,
                       alternatives=False,
