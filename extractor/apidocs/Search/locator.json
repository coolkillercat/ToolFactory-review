  "search_GET.py": "Search - Nominatim Manual\n\n[Skip to content](#search-queries)\n\n# Search queries\n\nThe search API allows you to look up a location from a textual description\nor address. Nominatim supports structured and free-form search queries.\n\nThe search query may also contain\n[special phrases](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Nominatim/Special_Phrases)\nwhich are translated into specific OpenStreetMap (OSM) tags (e.g. Pub => `amenity=pub`).\nThis can be used to narrow down the kind of objects to be returned.\n\n## Endpoint\n\nThe search API has the following format:\n\n```\nhttps://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/search?<params>\n\n```\n\nThe query term can be given in two different forms: free-form or structured.\n\n### Free-form query\n\n| Parameter | Value |\n| --- | --- |\n| q | Free-form query string to search for |\n\nIn this form, the query can be unstructured.\nFree-form queries are processed first left-to-right and then right-to-left if that fails. So you may search for\n[pilkington avenue, birmingham](https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/search?q=pilkington+avenue,birmingham) as well as for\n[birmingham, pilkington avenue](https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/search?q=birmingham,+pilkington+avenue).\nCommas are optional, but improve performance by reducing the complexity of the search.\n\nThe free-form may also contain special phrases to describe the type of\nplace to be returned or a coordinate to search close to a position.\n\n### Structured query\n\n| Parameter | Value |\n| --- | --- |\n| amenity | name and/or type of POI |\n| street | housenumber and streetname |\n| city | city |\n| county | county |\n| state | state |\n| country | country |\n| postalcode | postal code |\n\nThe structured form of the search query allows to lookup up an address\nthat is already split into its components. Each parameter represents a field\nof the address. All parameters are optional. You should only use the ones\nthat are relevant for the address you want to geocode.\n\n## Parameters\n\nThe following parameters can be used to further restrict the search and\nchange the output. They are usable for both forms of the search query.\n\n### Output format\n\n| Parameter | Value | Default |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| format | one of: `xml`, `json`, `jsonv2`, `geojson`, `geocodejson` | `jsonv2` |\n\nSee [Place Output Formats](https://nominatim.org/release-docs/develop/api/Output/) for details on each format.\n\n| Parameter | Value | Default |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| json\\_callback | function name | *unset* |\n\nWhen given, then JSON output will be wrapped in a callback function with\nthe given name. See [JSONP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSONP) for more\ninformation.\n\nOnly has an effect for JSON output formats.\n\n| Parameter | Value | Default |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| limit | number | 10 |\n\nLimit the maximum number of returned results. Cannot be more than 40.\nNominatim may decide to return less results than given, if additional\nresults do not sufficiently match the query.\n\n### Output details\n\n| Parameter | Value | Default |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| addressdetails | 0 or 1 | 0 |\n\nWhen set to 1, include a breakdown of the address into elements.\nThe exact content of the address breakdown depends on the output format.\n\n| Parameter | Value | Default |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| extratags | 0 or 1 | 0 |\n\nWhen set to 1, the response include any additional information in the result\nthat is available in the database, e.g. wikipedia link, opening hours.\n\n| Parameter | Value | Default |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| namedetails | 0 or 1 | 0 |\n\nWhen set to 1, include a full list of names for the result. These may include\nlanguage variants, older names, references and brand.\n\n### Language of results\n\n| Parameter | Value | Default |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| accept-language | browser language string | content of \"Accept-Language\" HTTP header |\n\nPreferred language order for showing search results. This may either be\na simple comma-separated list of language codes or have the same format\nas the [\"Accept-Language\" HTTP header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Accept-Language).\n\n### Result restriction\n\nThere are two ways to influence the results. *Filters* exclude certain\nkinds of results completely. *Boost parameters* only change the order of the\nresults and thus give a preference to some results over others.\n\n| Parameter | Value | Default |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| countrycodes | comma-separated list of country codes | *unset* |\n\nFilter that limits the search results to one or more countries.\nThe country code must be the\n[ISO 3166-1alpha2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2) code\nof the country, e.g. `gb` for the United Kingdom, `de` for Germany.\n\nEach place in Nominatim is assigned to one country code based\non OSM country boundaries. In rare cases a place may not be in any country\nat all, for example, when it is in international waters. These places are\nalso excluded when the filter is set.\n\n| Parameter | Value | Default |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| layer | comma-separated list of: `address`, `poi`, `railway`, `natural`, `manmade` | *unset* (no restriction) |\n\nThe layer filter allows to select places by themes.\n\nThe `address` layer contains all places that make up an address:\naddress points with house numbers, streets, inhabited places (suburbs, villages,\ncities, states tec.) and administrative boundaries.\n\nThe `poi` layer selects all point of interest. This includes classic POIs like\nrestaurants, shops, hotels but also less obvious features like recycling bins,\nguideposts or benches.\n\nThe `railway` layer includes railway infrastructure like tracks.\nNote that in Nominatim's standard configuration, only very few railway\nfeatures are imported into the database.\n\nThe `natural` layer collects features like rivers, lakes and mountains while\nthe `manmade` layer functions as a catch-all for features not covered by the\nother layers.\n\n| Parameter | Value | Default |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| featureType | one of: `country`, `state`, `city`, `settlement` | *unset* |\n\nThe featureType allows to have a more fine-grained selection for places\nfrom the address layer. Results can be restricted to places that make up\nthe 'state', 'country' or 'city' part of an address. A featureType of\n`settlement` selects any human inhabited feature from 'state' down to\n'neighbourhood'.\n\nWhen featureType is set, then results are automatically restricted\nto the address layer (see above).\n\n| Parameter | Value | Default |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| exclude\\_place\\_ids | comma-separated list of place ids |  |\n\nIf you do not want certain OSM objects to appear in the search\nresult, give a comma separated list of the `place_id`s you want to skip.\nThis can be used to retrieve additional search results. For example, if a\nprevious query only returned a few results, then including those here would\ncause the search to return other, less accurate, matches (if possible).\n\n| Parameter | Value | Default |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| viewbox | `<x1>,<y1>,<x2>,<y2>` | *unset* |\n\nBoost parameter which focuses the search on the given area.\nAny two corner points of the box are accepted as long as they make a proper\nbox. `x` is longitude, `y` is latitude.\n\n| Parameter | Value | Default |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| bounded | 0 or 1 | 0 |\n\nWhen set to 1, then it turns the 'viewbox' parameter (see above) into\na filter parameter, excluding any results outside the viewbox.\n\nWhen `bounded=1` is given and the viewbox is small enough, then an amenity-only\nsearch is allowed. Give the special keyword for the amenity in square\nbrackets, e.g. `[pub]` and a selection of objects of this type is returned.\nThere is no guarantee that the result returns all objects in the area.\n\n### Polygon output\n\n| Parameter | Value | Default |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| polygon\\_geojson | 0 or 1 | 0 |\n| polygon\\_kml | 0 or 1 | 0 |\n| polygon\\_svg | 0 or 1 | 0 |\n| polygon\\_text | 0 or 1 | 0 |\n\nAdd the full geometry of the place to the result output. Output formats\nin GeoJSON, KML, SVG or WKT are supported. Only one of these\noptions can be used at a time."
